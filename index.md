## Hi there! 😁
I'm a rising senior 🕛at the Nueva School 🌊 in San Mateo, CA 🧸. I love word puzzles 📰, dogs 🐶, and pickup basketball 🏀. I'm of proud Korean 🇰🇷 and Japanese 🇯🇵 mixed heritage. I'm a patient listener 👂 with a good sense of humor 😺. My pronouns are he/him.

I am a violinist 🎻, a researcher 🔬, a runner 🏃, a podcaster 🎙️, a dogwalker 🦮, an inventor 💡, a tutor 👨‍🏫, a cook 🍳, an avid reader 📖, a cuber 🧊, a juggler 🤹, and Chinese student ㊗️.
